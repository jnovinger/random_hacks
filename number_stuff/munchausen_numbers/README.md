# Munchausen Numbers

So, according to <http://www.blog.republicofmath.com/archives/4727> and <http://www.blog.republicofmath.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/On_a_curious_property_of_3435.pdf>,
the numbers 1 and 3435 share the interesting property that when the number is exploded in to its individual digits and each digit is then raised to the power of itself,
and then summed, that the sum will be equal to the original number. Both of these sources claim a proof (which I don't doubt, of course). However, I am more of an
experimental person by nature and always looking for an interesting puzzle to code up.
